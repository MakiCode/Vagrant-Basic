Basic vagrant provisioner.
==========================

Just git clone it, cd into the directory and run 'vagrant up'. Made for virtual box on Mac OSX. To run scripts before provisioning, make a directory called 'first' and place your scripts inside it; the scripts will be run in alphabetical order. To run scripts after provisioning, make a directory called 'last' and place your scripts inside it; these will also be run in alphabetical order. Both of these directories should be in the same folder as the provision script.
